# nnets with Back-propagation

The main objective of this project is to explore how to implement deep learning structures from scratch by using their underlying mathematical principles, rather than relying on the black box of pre-built machine learning libraries. Exploring how neural networks work internally has been extremely valuable in building my understanding of the underlying algorithms that power AI today.
